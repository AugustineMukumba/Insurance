            <h1>Our Offerings​</h1>

            <h3>Comprehensive Damage Cover</h3>

            <p>
                You may already be aware that Third Party Liability Car Insurance is mandatory by law. Therefore, if you own a car, you are mandated by law to take up a Third Party Liability Cover. However, taking up a car insurance policy that doesn't compensate your own damages seems pointless, doesn't it? A comprehensive damage cover was developed to offer a broad coverage against all possible damages arising from a variety of risks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our comprehensive car insurance policy offers protection against damages caused to your car by way of risks such as collisions, theft, fire and so on. Additionally, a comprehensive car insurance policy also covers third-party liabilities and offers extensive protection for your car.
            </p>

            <h3>Add-On cov​ers</h3>
